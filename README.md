# Tokenization 

## Retrying payments with Meta Tokens

With Meta Tokens, you can collect existing tokens from shoppers, ranked by their chances of completing a successful transaction. Using this method, you can try payment with the highest-ranking token, and if it fails, you can retry payment with the second-ranking token. In addition, this allows you to share tokens across multiple shops under the same company.

Tokenization is a process of replacing sensitive data with non-sensitive data.

A metatoken is a collection of a shopper's existing tokens, ranked according to how likely they lead to a successful transaction (based on our machine learning algorithm).

### Benefits of tokenization

- Increase revenues for businesses, especially those with subscription models.
- Let users share across multiple shops under the same company.
- Offer more secure payment. 
- Reuse of meta-token in retried payment. 


### Authentication

Each request to the MetaToken must include an API KEY. Set this key to the x-api-key header value, for example:

```
curl https://checkout-test.adyen.com/v68/metaTokens \
-H 'x-api-key: ' \
-H 'content-type: application/JSON \
â€¦
```
### Versioning

The version suffix has the following format: "vXX," where XX is the version number. 

For example:

`` https://checkout-test.adyen.com/v68/metaTokens ``

##### **List of questions that I asked when documenting the feature.**

1. How can I get `API KEY`? 
2. How is the ` shopperReference` obtained? 
3. How is the merchant identifier obtained?  
4. Can you point me to the information about the description of the parameters?
